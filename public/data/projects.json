It is meant to be a all-in-one SaaS solution that allows travel agencies to easily create custom-made travels for their customers by relying on a database of places, hotels and services. The software generate custom websites and PDF documents that can be easily shared with the customer so he can visualize different informations (itinerary, hotels, activities, costs...) about his travel. The solution also allows agencies to estimate the expenses and gains related to each creation, and to create a personal profile for each customer that helps them provide better services. It has been conceived a single-page Angular application wich communicates with a high-performance RESTful Symfony backend. I coded a great part of the application, which gave me a precious insight into the two frameworks that were used in its making. It's an ongoing project still under development.",
