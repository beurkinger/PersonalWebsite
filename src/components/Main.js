          These days I mostly do <strong>front-end</strong> stuff,
          and I'm experimenting with <strong>datavisulization</strong>.
          I'm heavily into <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and I have a pretty good hold
          on <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Inferno</strong> and <strong>d3</strong>.

          Nevertheless I can also work server-side and write some general-use scripts, thanks
          to my knowledge of <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I spent
          two years working every day with the <strong>Symfony</strong> framework.
          I also write <strong>MySql</strong> queries in my spare-time (ok not really but I have the know-how).
